## Hi there 👋

👩‍💻 Hi, I'm [Ana](https://www.anagoldman.com/), a Software Developer with a passion for Front-End Development.

💡 I've focused on creating user-friendly web applications using [React](https://reactjs.org/), [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). I thrive on new challenges and continuous growth. 

📸 In my free time, I enjoy capturing moments with my film camera.

💼 At the moment I'm actively looking for a new position! Previously, at AMZScout, I worked on an SSG app based on [Astro](https://astro.build/), [React](https://reactjs.org/) (and later [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)), integrated with [Sanity CMS](https://www.sanity.io/).

🌱 I'm currently exploring [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

📨 Reach out if you'd like to collab, my email is on my profile!
